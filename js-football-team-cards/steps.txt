Learn Modern JavaScript Methods By Building Football Team Cards, Not started
One common aspect of building web applications: processing datasets, and then outputting information to the screen. In this sports team cards project, you'll learn how to work with DOM manipulation, object destructuring, event handling, and data filtering.

This project will cover concepts like switch statements, default parameters, Object.freeze(), the map() method, and more.

Step 1
In this project, you will build a set of football team cards and learn about nested objects, object destructuring, default parameters, event listeners, and switch statements. All of the HTML and CSS for this project has been provided for you.
Start by accessing the id called team from the HTML document and storing it in a const variable called teamName.
Remember, you can use the getElementById method for this.
    const teamName = document.getElementById("team");

Step 2
Next, access the id called sport from the HTML document and store it in a const variable called typeOfSport. Below that variable, assign the id of year to a const variable called worldCupYear.
    const typeOfSport = document.getElementById("sport");
    const worldCupYear = document.getElementById("year");

Step 3
Next, access the id called head-coach from the HTML document and store it in a const variable called headCoach. Below that variable, assign the id of player-cards to a const variable called playerCards.
    const headCoach = document.getElementById("head-coach");
    const playerCards = document.getElementById("player-cards");

Step 4
Create one more const variable called playersDropdownList and assign it the id of players using the getElementById method.
    const playersDropdownList = document.getElementById("players");
Step 5
Now it is time to build out the data structure that will hold all of the information for your football team.
Below the variables you just created, create a new const variable called myFavoriteFootballTeam and assign it an empty object.
    const myFavoriteFootballTeam = {};

Step 6
Inside the myFavoriteFootballTeam object, add a new property with a key named team and a string value of Argentina.
const myFavoriteFootballTeam = {
  team: "Argentina",
};

Step 7
Below the team property, add a new property with a key named sport and a string value of Football.
const myFavoriteFootballTeam = {
  team: "Argentina",
  sport: "Football",
};

Step 8
Below the sport property, add a new property with a key named year and a number value of 1986.
const myFavoriteFootballTeam = {
  team: "Argentina",
  sport: "Football",
  year: 1986,
};

Step 9
Below the year property, add a new property with a key named isWorldCupWinner and a boolean value set to true.
const myFavoriteFootballTeam = {
  team: "Argentina",
  sport: "Football",
  year: 1986,
  isWorldCupWinner: true,
};

Step 10
Below the isWorldCupWinner property, add a new key called headCoach with a value of an empty object. Inside that object, add a property with a key of coachName and a string value of Carlos Bilardo. Below that property, add another key called matches with a number value of 7.
headCoach: {
  coachName: "Carlos Bilardo",
  matches: 7
},

Step 11
Below the headCoach property, create a new property with a key named players with the value of an empty array.
  headCoach: {
    coachName: "Carlos Bilardo",
    matches: 7,
  },
  players: [],

Step 12
Inside that players array, create a new object with the following properties:
players: [
    {
        name: "Sergio AlmirÃ³n",
        position: "forward",
        number: 1,
        isCaptain: false,
        nickname: null,
    }
]

Step 13
Below that object, create a new object with the following properties:
{
      name: "Sergio Batista",
      position: "midfielder",
      number: 2,
      isCaptain: false,
      nickname: null,
},

Step 14
The rest of the data for the myFavoriteFootballTeam.players array has been filled out for you.
The next step is to ensure that you can't modify this object by adding or removing any properties. We are going to use a method called Object.freeze(obj) which will freeze this object and prevent any changes being made to it.
Use the Object.freeze() method to freeze the myFavoriteFootballTeam object
    Object.freeze(myFavoriteFootballTeam);

Step 15
To check if the Object.freeze() method is working, you can try to assign a new value to one of the existing properties.
Below the Object.freeze(myFavoriteFootballTeam), assign the USA string to myFavoriteFootballTeam.team. Below that, add a console.log for myFavoriteFootballTeam.team.
When you open up the console, you will see an Uncaught TypeError message. This error appears because the Object.freeze() method does not allow you to overwrite that value.
myFavoriteFootballTeam.team = "USA";
console.log(myFavoriteFootballTeam.team)

Step 16
Now that you have tested the Object.freeze() method, you can delete those two lines of code from the last lesson.
The next step is to access the key called sport from the myFavoriteFootballTeam object and assign it to a new const variable called sport.
Remember you can use dot notation for this.
const sport = myFavoriteFootballTeam.sport;

Step 17
Below the sport variable, access the key called team from the myFavoriteFootballTeam object and assign it to a new const variable called team.
const sport = myFavoriteFootballTeam.sport;
const team = myFavoriteFootballTeam.team;

Step 18
In the last two steps, you have been accessing properties from the myFavoriteFootballTeam object using dot notation and assigning them to new const variables. But in JavaScript, there is an easier way to accomplish the same goal.
The object destructuring syntax allows you to unpack values from arrays and objects:

const developerObj = {
  name: "Jessica Wilkins",
  isDeveloper: true
};

// Object destructuring
const { name, isDeveloper } = developerObj;
Rewrite the two lines of code below using the new destructuring syntax. Your answer should be one line of code.
const { sport, team } = myFavoriteFootballTeam;

Step 19
Next, add the year and players to your destructuring assignment.
const { sport, team, year, players } = myFavoriteFootballTeam;

Step 20
Now you need to access the coachName value from the myFavoriteFootballTeam.headCoach object using the destructuring syntax.
const { coachName } = myFavoriteFootballTeam.headCoach;

Step 21
Now you need to start displaying the team's information on the screen.
Below your destructuring assignments, assign the sport variable to typeOfSport.textContent.
Once you complete that task, you should see the result in the preview window.
typeOfSport.textContent = sport;

Step 22
Next, assign the team variable to teamName.textContent.
teamName.textContent = team;

Step 23
Assign the year variable to worldCupYear.textContent.
Below that, assign the coachName variable to headCoach.textContent.
You should now see all of that information displayed on the screen below Team stats.
worldCupYear.textContent = year;
headCoach.textContent = coachName;

Step 24
Now you will start building out the function that will show player cards based on the selections made by the user in the Filter Teammates dropdown menu.
Start by creating an empty arrow function called setPlayerCards. You do not need to add a parameter because that will be taken care of in the next step.
const setPlayerCards = () => {};

Step 25
Function parameters can be initialized with default values. If a function is called without an argument, then the default value will be used:
const greeting = (name = "Anonymous") => {
  return "Hello " + name;
} 
console.log(greeting("John")); // Hello John
console.log(greeting()); // Hello Anonymous
Add a new parameter to your setPlayerCards function called arr and assign it a default value of players.
const setPlayerCards = (arr = players) => {};

Step 26
The next step is to create a new array that will be responsible for adding the player card information to the page.
Inside the setPlayerCards function, start by adding the map method to arr that will take in an empty callback function. Then, use the addition assignment += operator to assign the new array to playerCards.innerHTML.
Remember that the innerHTML property gets, or in this case, sets the HTML markup for the playerCards element.
pconst setPlayerCards = (arr = players) => {
    playerCards.innerHTML += arr.map(() => {});
}

Step 27
arr contains a series of objects that each contain a name, position, number, isCaptain and nickname property. In order to access each of those properties inside the callback function, you will need to use object destructuring to unpack them into variables.
Here is an example:
    function myExampleFunction({ name, age, job, city }) {
}
Inside the parameter list in the callback function for the map method, unpack all 5 object properties from objects in arr using object destructuring.
  playerCards.innerHTML += arr.map(({ name, position, number, isCaptain, nickname }) => {
    
  })

Step 28
Inside the body of the callback function, you will need to add template literals `` which will contain the HTML content for the player cards.
Inside the template literals, add an empty div with a class of player-card.
  playerCards.innerHTML += arr.map(
    ({ name, position, number, isCaptain, nickname }) => {
        `
        <div class="player-card"></div>
        `
    }
  );

Step 29
Inside the div, add an h2 element which contains the name parameter. Since you are working with template literals, you will need to use an embedded expression for the name parameter:
${expression goes here}
  playerCards.innerHTML += arr.map(
    ({ name, position, number, isCaptain, nickname }) => {
      `
        <div class="player-card">
          <h2>${name}</h2>
      
        </div>
      `;
    }
  );

Step 30
The next step would be to display the word (Captain) next to the player if they are listed as a captain for the team.
Right next to the ${name} expression, add a new embedded expression. Inside that expression, use a ternary operator to check if isCaptain is true. If so, return (Captain) otherwise return an empty string.
  playerCards.innerHTML += arr.map(
    ({ name, position, number, isCaptain, nickname }) => {
      `
        <div class="player-card">
          <h2>${name}${isCaptain ? '(Captain)' : ''}</h2>
        </div>
      `;
    }
  );

Step 31
Below the h2 element, add a paragraph element with the text Position: and an embedded expression that contains the position parameter.
  playerCards.innerHTML += arr.map(
    ({ name, position, number, isCaptain, nickname }) => {
      `
        <div class="player-card">
          <h2>${name} ${isCaptain ? "(Captain)" : ""}</h2>
          <p>Position: ${position}</p>
          
        </div>
      `;
    }
  );

Step 32
Below the paragraph element, add another paragraph element with the text Number: and an embedded expression that contains the number parameter.
  playerCards.innerHTML += arr.map(
    ({ name, position, number, isCaptain, nickname }) => {
      `
        <div class="player-card">
          <h2>${name} ${isCaptain ? "(Captain)" : ""}</h2>
          <p>Position: ${position}</p>
          <p>Number: ${number}</p>
        </div>
      `;
    }
  );

Step 33
Below your existing paragraph elements, add another paragraph element with the text Nickname: .
const setPlayerCards = (arr = players) => {


  playerCards.innerHTML += arr.map(
    ({ name, position, number, isCaptain, nickname }) => {
      `
        <div class="player-card">
          <h2>${name} ${isCaptain ? "(Captain)" : ""}</h2>
          <p>Position: ${position}</p>
          <p>Number: ${number}</p>
          <p>Nickname: </p>
        </div>
      `;
    });
  }

Step 34
Next to the Nickname: text, add an embedded expression that will show the player's nickname if they have one.
Use a ternary operator to check if nickname is not null. If the player has a nickname, display nickname otherwise display "N/A".
const setPlayerCards = (arr = players) => {


  playerCards.innerHTML += arr.map(
    ({ name, position, number, isCaptain, nickname }) => {
      `
        <div class="player-card">
          <h2>${name} ${isCaptain ? "(Captain)" : ""}</h2>
          <p>Position: ${position}</p>
          <p>Number: ${number}</p>
          <p>Nickname: ${nickname !== null ? nickname : "N/A"}</p>
        </div>
      `;
    });
  }

Step 35
The .map() method will return a new array of player-card items separated by commas.
To remove the commas between each player-card so it does not show up on screen, chain the .join() method to the .map() method. Pass an empty string as the argument for the .join() method.
const setPlayerCards = (arr = players) => {
  playerCards.innerHTML += arr.map(
    ({ name, position, number, isCaptain, nickname }) => {
      `
        <div class="player-card">
          <h2>${name} ${isCaptain ? "(Captain)" : ""}</h2>
          <p>Position: ${position}</p>
          <p>Number: ${number}</p>
          <p>Nickname: ${nickname !== null ? nickname : "N/A"}</p>
        </div>
      `;
    }
  ).join("")
};

Step 36
The next step is to create a function that will detect when a user makes a selection from the playersDropdownList.
Use the .addEventListener() method on playersDropdownList. Inside the event listener, pass in a change event type and an empty callback function.
playersDropdownList.addEventListener("change", () => {});

Step 37
For the callback function, pass in e as a parameter.
e represents an object which contains the information for that event.
playersDropdownList.addEventListener("change", (e) => {

});

Step 38
Inside the callback function, add a console.log with the value of e.target.value.
Open the console, and make a selection from the teammates dropdown menu. You should see the value of that selection in the console.
e.target.value represents the value property from the playersDropdownList element. In future steps, you will use this value to show player cards based on the position they play.
console.log(e.target.value);

Step 39
Remove the console.log statement you created in the previous step.
The next step would be to reset the content for the playerCards element.
Inside the callback function, access the innerHTML property of the playerCards element and assign it a value of an empty string.
playerCards.innerHTML = "";

Step 40
The next step would be to add a switch statement which will check for the user's selection from the player dropdown menu and filter out cards based on the player's positions.
Add a switch statement and use e.target.value for the expressio
  switch (e.target.value) {

  }

Step 41
If the user selects Nicknames from the dropdown menu you will want to filter out player cards that have a nickname.
Start by adding a case clause for nickname inside your switch statement.
  switch (e.target.value) {
    case "nickname":
  }

Step 42
Call the setPlayerCards function with an argument of players.filter().
Inside the filter method, add a callback function with a parameter called player and implicitly return player.nickname is not null.
playersDropdownList.addEventListener("change", (e) => {
  playerCards.innerHTML = "";
  switch (e.target.value) {
    case "nickname":
      setPlayerCards(players.filter((player) => player.nickname !== null));
  }
});

Step 43
Before you can move onto the next case, you will need to add a break statement.
Below your setPlayerCards call, add a break statement.
playersDropdownList.addEventListener("change", (e) => {
  playerCards.innerHTML = "";
  switch (e.target.value) {
    case "nickname":
      setPlayerCards(players.filter((player) => player.nickname !== null));
      break;
  }
});

Step 44
Next, add a case clause for forward.
Inside that case, call the setPlayerCards function with an argument of players.filter().
Inside the filter() method, add a callback function with a parameter of player that will check if player.position equals forward.
Lastly, add a break statement below the setPlayerCards function call.
playersDropdownList.addEventListener("change", (e) => {
  playerCards.innerHTML = "";
  switch (e.target.value) {
    case "nickname":
      setPlayerCards(players.filter((player) => player.nickname !== null));
      break;
    case "forward":
      setPlayerCards(players.filter((player) => player.position == "forward"));
      break;
  }
});

Step 45
Add a new case for midfielder that checks if player.position equals midfielder following the same pattern from the previous step.
playersDropdownList.addEventListener("change", (e) => {
  playerCards.innerHTML = "";
  switch (e.target.value) {
    case "nickname":
      setPlayerCards(players.filter((player) => player.nickname !== null));
      break;
    case "forward":
      setPlayerCards(players.filter((player) => player.position === "forward"));
      break;
    case "midfielder":
      setPlayerCards(players.filter((player) => player.position === "midfielder"));
      break;
  }
});

Step 46
Add a new case for defender that checks if player.position equals defender following the same pattern as the previous step.
playersDropdownList.addEventListener("change", (e) => {
  playerCards.innerHTML = "";
  switch (e.target.value) {
    case "nickname":
      setPlayerCards(players.filter((player) => player.nickname !== null));
      break;
    case "forward":
      setPlayerCards(players.filter((player) => player.position === "forward"));
      break;
    case "midfielder":
      setPlayerCards(players.filter((player) => player.position === "midfielder"));
      break;
    case "defender":
        setPlayerCards(players.filter((player) => player.position === "defender"));
        break;
  }
});

Step 47
Add a new case for goalkeeper that checks if player.position equals goalkeeper following the same pattern as the previous step.
playersDropdownList.addEventListener("change", (e) => {
  playerCards.innerHTML = "";
  switch (e.target.value) {
    case "nickname":
      setPlayerCards(players.filter((player) => player.nickname !== null));
      break;
    case "forward":
      setPlayerCards(players.filter((player) => player.position === "forward"));
      break;
    case "midfielder":
      setPlayerCards(players.filter((player) => player.position === "midfielder"));
      break;
    case "defender":
        setPlayerCards(players.filter((player) => player.position === "defender"));
        break;
    case "goalkeeper":
        setPlayerCards(players.filter((player) => player.position === "goalkeeper"));
        break;
  }
});

Step 48
The final step is to add a default clause if none of the other case clauses match the user selection.
For the default clause, call the setPlayerCards function without any arguments passed in.
Test out your dropdown menu, and you should see the player cards be filtered out by position or nickname.
Congratulations on completing the football team cards project!

playersDropdownList.addEventListener("change", (e) => {
  playerCards.innerHTML = "";
  switch (e.target.value) {
    case "nickname":
      setPlayerCards(players.filter((player) => player.nickname !== null));
      break;
    case "forward":
      setPlayerCards(players.filter((player) => player.position === "forward"));
      break;
    case "midfielder":
      setPlayerCards(players.filter((player) => player.position === "midfielder"));
      break;
    case "defender":
        setPlayerCards(players.filter((player) => player.position === "defender"));
        break;
    case "goalkeeper":
        setPlayerCards(players.filter((player) => player.position === "goalkeeper"));
        break;
    default: 
        setPlayerCards();
  }
});
