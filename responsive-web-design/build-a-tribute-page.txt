          <li>
            <strong>1981</strong> - Danny Hillis designed parallel computers for
            AI and other computational tasks, an architecture similar to modern
            GPUs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1984</strong> - Marvin Minsky and Roger Schank coined the
            term AI winter at a meeting of the Association for the Advancement
            of Artificial Intelligence, warning the business community that AI
            hype would lead to disappointment and the collapse of the industry,
            which happened three years later.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1985</strong> - Judea Pearl introduced Bayesian networks
            causal analysis, which provides statistical techniques for

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2000</strong> - University of Montreal researchers published

            model language using feedforward neural networks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2006</strong> - Fei-Fei Li started working on the ImageNet
            visual database, introduced in 2009, which became a catalyst for the
            AI boom and the basis of an annual competition for image recognition
            algorithms. IBM Watson originated with the initial goal of beating a
            human on the iconic quiz show Jeopardy! In 2011, the
            question-answering computer system defeated the show's all-time

            implementation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2013</strong> - China's Tianhe-2 doubled the world's top
            supercomputing speed at 33.86 petaflops, retaining the title of the
            world's fastest system for the third consecutive time. DeepMind
            introduced deep reinforcement learning, a CNN that learned based on
            rewards and learned to play games through repetition, surpassing
            human expert levels. Google researcher Tomas Mikolov and colleagues

            autoencoders to generate images, videos and text. Facebook developed
            the deep learning facial recognition system DeepFace, which
            identifies human faces in digital images with near-human accuracy.
          </li>

            diffusion models in the paper "Deep Unsupervised Learning Using
            Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics." The technique provides a way to
            reverse-engineer the process of adding noise to a final image.
            Google researchers developed the concept of transformers in the
            seminal paper "Attention Is All You Need," inspiring subsequent
            research into tools that could automatically parse unlabeled text
            into large language models (LLMs). British physicist Stephen Hawking
            warned, "Unless we learn how to prepare for, and avoid, the
            potential risks, AI could be the worst event in the history of our
            civilization."
          </li>

            <strong>2018</strong> - Developed by IBM, Airbus and the German
            Aerospace Center DLR, Cimon was the first robot sent into space to
            assist astronauts. OpenAI released GPT (Generative Pre-trained
            Transformer), paving the way for subsequent LLMs. Groove X unveiled
            a home mini-robot called Lovot that could sense and affect mood

          <li>
            <strong>2021</strong> - OpenAI introduced the Dall-E multimodal AI
            system that can generate images from text prompts. The University of
            California, San Diego, created a four-legged soft robot that
            functioned on pressurized air instead of electronics.
          </li>
          <li>

            fired for revealing secrets of Lamda and claiming it was sentient.
            DeepMind unveiled AlphaTensor "for discovering novel, efficient and
            provably correct algorithms." Intel claimed its FakeCatcher
            real-time deepfake detector was 96% accurate. OpenAI released
            ChatGPT in November to provide a chat-based interface to its GPT-3.5
            LLM.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023</strong> - OpenAI announced the GPT-4 multimodal LLM
            that receives both text and image prompts. Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak
            and thousands more signatories urged a six-month pause on training
            "AI systems more powerful than GPT-4."

            " The pace of progress in artificial intelligence (I'm not referring
            to narrow AI) is incredibly fast. Unless you have direct exposure to
            groups like Deepmind, you have no idea how fast-it is growing at a
            pace close to exponential. The risk of something seriously dangerous
            happening is in the five year timeframe. 10 years at most. This is
            not a case of crying wolf about something I don't understand. I am
            not alone in thinking we should be worried. The leading AI companies
            have taken great steps to ensure safety. The recognize the danger,
            but believe that they can shape and control the digital
            superintelligences and prevent bad ones from escaping into the
            Internet. That remains to be seen... "
